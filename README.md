# My 60 Days of Learning Java

Welcome to my **60-day journey of learning Java**! 🚀 This repository serves as my personal notebook, where I document my progress, challenges, and key concepts learned each day.

## 📌 Why Java?
Java, created by **James Gosling** at Sun Microsystems in 1995, is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. Its platform independence, strong memory management, and object-oriented design make it a favorite among developers. Java is the backbone of enterprise applications, Android development, and large-scale systems used by big tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Netflix.
